## SUMMARY

Experience one of the most scenic treks in the Cordillera Blanca, crossing valleys, lakes, and high mountain passes. The Santa Cruz trek offers breathtaking views of iconic peaks like Alpamayo and Artesonraju, diverse landscapes, and a unique adventure through the heart of the Peruvian Andes.

## ITINERARY:

### DAY 1: HUARAZ - LLAMACORRAL.

We leave Huaraz at 8:00 am by a private transport to Cashapampa (2,800 m.a.s.l.), 2 hs driving, where we start the hike, it’s about 4 hours walk to Llamacorral (3,700 m.a.s.l.), this is our first night at the camp.

### Day 2: LLAMACORRAL - CAMPO BASE ALPAMAYO.

After breakfast we continue our walk to the next camp, this is approximately 6 hours. The path is mostly straight but at the end, just before reaching our campsite, you climb up to 4,100 m.a.s.l. where we will see a sign that takes us to the viewpoint, from where we can appreciate more closely the snowy Santa Cruz, Quitaraju, Artesonraju and Alpamayo, the most beautiful mountain in the world, as well as the two lakes of Ichicocha and Hatuncocha. Here we stop to set up camp. We will also appreciate the spectacular peaks of the snow-capped mountains of Taulliraju, Rinrijirca, Quitaraju, Pumapampa, Paria and Artesonraju.

### Day 3: CAMP BASE ALPAMAYO - TAULLIPAMPA - PUNTA UNION PASSAGE - PARIA.

This is the longest day of the trekking. Breakfast early, we walked for seven hours. We leave the camp, descending towards Taulipampa at
4200 meters, then we go up the Punta Union Pass (\_), the highest point at 4,750 m.a.s.l. From here we continue our path maintaining height, we take a non-popular path, as the one that is going down the valley of Huaripampa, from this non-popular option you can see more snowpicks.
Just before reaching the third campsite, we pass through a beautiful forest of Quenual trees (typical for the region). The “Paria” field is at
3,800 m.a.s.l. in a valley surrounded by Quenuales trees, rivers and waterfalls.
This old road was widely used in pre-Columbian and colonial times as a route to transport goods from the east side of the Andes to the main valley.

### Day 4: HUARIPAMPA - VAQUERIA - HUARAZ

The fourth and last day is short (4 hours). At the end you climb up a hill
to reach a place called Vaquería. A private transport is waiting for us
and takes us back to Huaraz.
