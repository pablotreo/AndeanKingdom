# Summary

The Santa Cruz trek is one of the most famous hiking circuits in the Cordillera Blanca, visited by hikers, climbers, cyclists, and mountain runners who come from different parts of the planet. It is located northeast of Huaraz, in the northern part of the Cordillera.  
The route visits canyons and lagoons formed by glaciers, snow-capped peaks over 5000 and 6000 meters above sea level; forests of quenuales and quiswar (typical trees of the Peruvian Andes); we camp in places above 3700m. Among the snow-capped mountains that we see up close are: Quitaraju 6036 m, the very famous Alpamayo 5947 m, Artesonraju 6025 m, and Taulliraju 5830 m. In addition to observing part of the fauna of this part of the mountain range, such as vizcachas, foxes, and a countless number of birds.

## Our Itinerary:

### Day 1: HUARAZ - LLAMACORRAL

We depart from Huaraz at 8:00 in the morning. We will travel by private transport to Cashapampa (2,800 meters above sea level), a 2-hour drive. Here, we begin our trek with a hike of about 4 hours to Llamacorral (3,700 meters above sea level). This is our first night at the campsite.

### Day 2: LLAMACORRAL - TAULLIPAMPA

After breakfast, we continue our hike to the next campsite. This is approximately a 6-hour hike and is relatively easy. The route is mostly straight, but towards the end, just before reaching the camp, you ascend to 4,100 meters above sea level where we will see a sign that leads us to a viewpoint. From here, we can appreciate the snow-capped mountains of Santa Cruz, Quitaraju, Artesonraju, and Alpamayo (the most beautiful mountain in the world) more closely, as well as the two lakes of Ichicocha and Hatuncocha. From here, we take a shortcut to the next camp in Taullipampa (4,200 meters above sea level). Here, you will see the spectacular peaks of the snow-capped mountains of Taulliraju (one of the most difficult to climb - about 21 days), Rinrijirca, Quitaraju, Pumapampa, Paria, and Artesonraju.

### Day 3: TAULLIPAMPA - PUNTA UNION PASS - HUARIPAMPA

This is the longest day of the trek. After an early breakfast, we hike for seven hours, passing through Punta Union Pass, the highest point at 4,750 meters above sea level, and then entering another valley with diverse vegetation. Moments before reaching the third campsite, we pass through a beautiful forest of Quenual trees (typical of the region). The "Huaripampa" camp is at 3,800 meters above sea level in a valley surrounded by Quenual trees, rivers, and waterfalls.  
This old road was widely used in pre-Columbian and colonial times as a route to transport goods from the east side of the Andes to the main valley.

### Day 4: HUARIPAMPA – VAQUERIA – HUARAZ

The fourth and final day is the shortest (4 hours). At the end, you climb a steep hill to reach a place called Vaqueria. A private transport takes us back to Huaraz.  
The 4th day does not have any mountain passes. The first 2-1/2 hours are flat, and from there, it is a 1-1/2 hour ascent until you reach Vaqueria.
